## 🐐 The Ultimate Enterprise Casino Solution

Welcome to the **GoatGang Edition** of the iKingSnipe Casino Framework. This isn't just another dicing script; it's a fully modular, enterprise-grade framework built on the modern **Tree-Branch-Leaf** architecture for maximum reliability and human-like behavior.

### 🚀 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tree-Branch-Leaf Architecture** | Modular design for extreme stability and easy expansion. |
| **Provably Fair System** | SHA-256 cryptographic hashing ensures 100% transparency. |
| **Multi-Game Support** | Dice Duel, Craps, Flower Poker, Hot/Cold, and more. |
| **Advanced Anti-Ban** | Dynamic humanization, micro-breaks, and adaptive reaction times. |
| **Enterprise Management** | Integrated MySQL database, Discord Bot, and Webhook notifications. |

### 🛠️ Professional Architecture

The framework is built for scripters and enterprise hosts who demand the best. By separating logic into **Branches** (decision making) and **Leaves** (execution), we've eliminated the "spaghetti code" found in most scripts.

```java
// Example of our clean implementation
public void initializeTree() {
    getRoot().addChild(new HumanizationLeaf(humanizationManager));
    getRoot().addChild(new MaintenanceBranch()
        .addChild(new MulingLeaf(muleManager))
        .addChild(new BankingLeaf(bankingManager)));
    getRoot().addChild(new HostingBranch(locationManager)
        .addChild(new TradeLeaf(tradeManager))
        .addChild(new GameExecutionLeaf(gameManager)));
}
```
